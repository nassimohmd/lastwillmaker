# Deployment Fix for Directory Structure Issue

## Problem
The deployment fails with the error:
- Build process creates `dist/public` directory  
- Static deployment expects `index.html` in `dist` directory
- Vite configuration outputs to `dist/public` instead of `dist`

## Solution
Since we cannot modify the core Vite configuration or .replit files, we've created a post-build process that automatically fixes the directory structure.

## Files Created

### 1. `scripts/post-build.js`
A Node.js script that:
- Checks if `dist/public` exists after build
- Moves all files from `dist/public` to `dist` root
- Removes the empty `dist/public` directory
- Verifies the presence of `index.html` in the correct location

### 2. `build.sh`
A bash script that:
- Runs the original `npm run build` command
- Executes the post-build script automatically
- Provides clear feedback on success/failure

## How to Deploy

### Option 1: Manual Build Fix
```bash
# Run this after any build to fix the directory structure
node scripts/post-build.js
```

### Option 2: Complete Build with Fix
```bash
# Run this instead of npm run build
./build.sh
```

## Testing the Fix

1. Run the build process
2. Check that `dist/index.html` exists (not `dist/public/index.html`)
3. Verify all assets are properly placed in `dist/`

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Check directory structure
ls -la dist/

# Verify index.html exists
ls -la dist/index.html

# Test if all files are in place
find dist/ -name "*.html" -o -name "*.js" -o -name "*.css"
```

## Next Steps

When you're ready to deploy:
1. Run `./build.sh` to create the deployment-ready files
2. The deployment system will find `index.html` in the correct location
3. Your application should deploy successfully

This solution works within the existing constraints and doesn't require modifying any core configuration files.
