## [Direct link to heading](https://design.cal.com/\#introduction)    Introduction

Everything here is split into three sections: basics, assets and Figma.

**Basics**, as the name infers, is a lot of the design tokens and simple stuff that you should base all designs upon.

**Assets** is an excellent collection of each of the different types of asset we've prepared, which are great to use in content and publications.

**Figma** contains all of the links to our Figma documents, which are considered the ultimate source of truth.
